# AGENTS.md

This file complements the workspace-level Ansiversa-workspace/AGENTS.md (source of truth). Read workspace first.

MANDATORY: After completing each task, update this repo’s AGENTS.md Task Log (newest-first) before marking the task done.

## Scope
- Mini-app repository for 'lesson-builder' within Ansiversa.
- Follow the parent-app contract from workspace AGENTS; do not invent architecture.

## Phase Status
- Freeze phase active: no new features unless explicitly approved.
- Allowed: verification, bug fixes, cleanup, behavior locking, and documentation/process hardening.

## Architecture & Workflow Reminders
- Prefer consistency over speed; match existing naming, spacing, and patterns.
- Keep Astro/Alpine patterns aligned with ecosystem standards (one global store pattern per app, actions via astro:actions, SSR-first behavior).
- Do not refactor or change established patterns without explicit approval.
- If unclear, stop and ask Karthikeyan/Astra before proceeding.

## Where To Look First
- Start with src/, src/actions/, src/stores/, and local docs/ if present.
- Review this repo's existing AGENTS.md Task Log history before making changes.

## Task Log (Recent)
- 2026-04-06 Rolled out Landing Page Standard V1.1 to Batch 2: replaced the minimal public landing with the approved Ansiversa V1.1 landing system (`src/lib/landing.ts`, repo-local `LandingPageStandard.astro`, and truthful `src/pages/index.astro`) aligned to the verified DB-backed manual lesson-planning scope (create/edit/favorite/archive/restore/filter/detail, no AI lesson generation claims). Verification: `npm run typecheck` ✅, `npm run build` ✅ (rerun clean after transient Vite cache rename issue), landing `/` and protected sign-in CTA destination re-checked.
- 2026-04-05 Completed Freeze Level 1 spec-driven verification against docs/app-spec.md; confirmed runtime/spec alignment for auth, lesson CRUD/favorite/archive flows, and safe route handling with no app-code fixes required.
- 2026-03-30 Populated app-spec.md with implementation-aligned V1 documentation based on current repo behavior and conservative pre-verification review.
- 2026-03-30 Initialized app-spec.md using standard V1 template from web repo.
- 2026-03-30 Initialized app-spec.md using standard V1 template from web repo.
- 2026-03-29 Completed readiness repair pass after DB isolation: preserved app-specific Turso DB env, added deprecated legacy lesson planning tables for non-destructive schema reconciliation, and verified `npm run typecheck`, `npm run build`, and `npm run db:push` all pass.
- 2026-03-29 Synced local repo to `origin/main` after stale local seed commit divergence blocked pull, aborted the interrupted rebase, and preserved prior local state on `backup/pre-pull-sync-2026-03-29`.
- Keep newest first; include date and short summary.
- 2026-03-25 Delivered Lesson Builder V1 manual planning workspace (Astro DB `Lessons`, ownership-enforced actions, Alpine global store, `/app` + detail route, archive/favorite/search filters, dashboard summary + high-signal notifications hooks, auth middleware scope fix); validated with `npm run typecheck` and `npm run build`.
- 2026-02-09 Added repo-level AGENTS.md enforcement contract (workspace reference + mandatory task-log update rule).
- 2026-02-09 Initialized repo AGENTS baseline for single-repo Codex/AI safety.
